*****CRUD OPERATIONS*****
1.Read - We can get the list of users in the dashboard.
2.Create - we can create a single user at once, with the image link to be uploaded for the avatar and after refreshing we can get result in dashboard.
3.Edit - 
4.Delete - We can delete a single user at once after refreshing we can get result in dashboard.
